PNRly
=====

##What ?

`PNRly` is a script that enables a user to track their Indian Railways' PNR status and update them if their status changes (For example, when a passenger's reservation status changes from `W/L 10` to `W/L 9` or from `W/L 1` to `S4, 30`/`CNF` etc.)

##Requisites ?
This script requires you to have an account on [FullOnSms.com](http://fullonsms.com). Your system also needs to have [Python 2.7](http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.5/) downloaded and installed (If you don't have it already).

##Working
To run the software,

* On `LINUX`

      * First `download` this script from the repository (Git Clone/Download ZIP)
      * `cd` to the extracted files directory

##Customization
The script checks the PNR status every 15 minutes (900 seconds). To change it, you can change the update frequency by editing the last line of `pnrly.py` script.

```
  time.sleep(900) #check every 15 minutes
```
